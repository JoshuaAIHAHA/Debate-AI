## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Topic Selection

- User inputs a debate topic or selects from predefined topics.
- Online scraper gathers current information on the topic.
- AI models receive context briefings, including external information.

### 2. Personality Generation

- Unique AI personalities are created for each debate.
- Traits are dynamically assigned, including debate styles and key characteristics.
- Individual approaches to argumentation are established.

### 3. Debate Initiation

- AIs generate responses based on personalities and debate parameters.
- Continuous exploration of the topic with natural evolution.
- Real-time integration of newly scraped information without restarting the debate.

### 4. Multimedia Output

- Text-based dialogue displayed in an interactive GUI.
- Optional speech synthesis using selected TTS engines.
- Sentiment visualization with emotion emojis and indicators.

## üîß Configuration

### API Key Setup

Obtain API keys for the following services:

- **OpenAI**
  - Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
  - Obtain your API key from the [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) section.
- **Google Custom Search**
  - Create a Custom Search Engine at [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com/).
  - Obtain your **Search Engine ID** and **API Key**.
- **Google AI Gemini**
  - Enable access to the Gemini API in your Google Cloud project.
  - Obtain your API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

  - **Google Cloud TTS**

### Setting Up API Keys

1. **Create a `config.py` File**

   In the root directory of the project, create a file named `config.py`.

2. **Add Your API Credentials to debate.py, Online_scraper.py and pre_debate_chat.py**

   ```python
   # OpenAI API Key
   OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-openai-api-key'

   # Google Custom Search API Key and Search Engine ID
   GOOGLE_API_KEY = 'your-google-api-key'
   SEARCH_ENGINE_ID = 'your-search-engine-id'

   # Google AI Gemini API Key
   GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-gemini-api-key'

   # Azure Cognitive Services API Key and Region
   -Line 950 and 951
   AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = 'your-azure-subscription-key'
   AZURE_REGION = 'your-azure-region'
   speech_config.endpoint = "your_azure_endpoint" 
   For eg "https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0"
